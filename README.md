# C_Generic_LinkedList
Implementation of a generic linked list in C

What you can learn from this repo:  
- See how to code a GENERIC Linked List in C, using void pointers for the data paramenter in a Node.
  - The addDataToLinkedList() function can show you have to copy data that is bing pointed to by a void pointer to another location.
  - Notice how we can typecast a pointer to char* and use it to copy memeory byte by byte.

- LinkedListExample is a simple CMAKE project that can show you how to use CMAKE to include LinkedList.h and LinkedList.c, alternatively you can use make directly.
